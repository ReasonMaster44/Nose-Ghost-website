Nose Ghost is a four-piece punk and indie rock project that delivers fuzz-driven, high energy riffs. With scratchy vocals, crunchy guitars and the occasional harmonica, they boast a sound that is both nostalgic and a breath of fresh air. Their goal on stage is to get the crowds moshing and moving.

Each member has musical influences from varying different genres, including jazz, pop, and metal.
